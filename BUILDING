The C library is maintained separately. Fetch it from
https://github.com/GregorR/musl , branch 'microcosm'.

To build Microcosm, create a subdirectory (e.g. build-x86_64), copy config.sh
to that directory, then run build.sh. It will build the cross compiler to
/opt/cross/<arch>-microcosm, and the runtime to /opt/microcosm.

To compile things:
    x86_64-microcosm-gcc test.c

To run them:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/cross/x86_64-microcosm/lib"
    /opt/microcosm/bin/microcosm ./a.out
